On the secenod video we are told what we are going to buld that is Leave Managment system.
then we follow setting up the folder. we created src and test folder. In src folder we created API, Core, Infrastracture and UI folder.
then we created the domain project. It is the model about what a different entity will contain. we created baseEntity for repeated entity.
finaly we created the application project. It is the interface that the ui and domain communicate.
